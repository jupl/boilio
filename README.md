## About
This is a boilerplate project for developing a mid to a large scale client-side application(s) using JavaScript, [Babel](http://babeljs.io/), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/). For an example project, visit the [example branch](https://github.com/jupl/omrb/tree/example).

### Entry Points
When JavaScript code is built, any files directly inside the `src/` directory are used to create the output files. The boilerplate currently generates `app.js`, as there is a single entry point inside `src/`. (`src/app.jsx`) If there are more than one entry points more files generated as well as an additional file `common.js`, which contains shared code across all entry points. `common.js` must be loaded before you load an entry point. You can see what gets generated by running the `build:dev`/`build:prod` task. (see the [tasks section](#tasks))

### Domains
```
domain/
├─ components/
│  ├─ component1/ # See Component sections below
│  ├─ component2/
│  └─ componentX/
├─ actions.js # Redux actions for domain
├─ reducer.js # Domain reducer
└─ saga.ts    # Domain sagas
```

Rather than group items by things like components/reducers/actions/etc., items are grouped by domain which can be a saner option as the project grows. Examples of domains can be things like resources (ex. `blog/`, `users/`) or other things. (ex. `ui/`) Domains may include things like components, actions, reducer, sagas, etc. but they don't have to include all of them. In fact, you can think of `app/` and `common/` as domains. Other files may be present as well.

### Components
```
component/
├─ index.js
└─ template.jsx
```

React componenjs are grouped in a directory.
- `template.jsx` defines the React component without any knowledge of Redux specifics or other things like React DnD. (sometimes referred as *dumb* component)
- `index.js` is the entry point of the component when used by others.
  - If template does not require data/action bindings then it can just pass through the template. (see `src/app/componenjs/root/index.js`)
  - If template requires data/action bindings then it is done here.  (sometimes refereed as *smart* component)

### Other Files

#### `*.test.js`, `*.test.jsx`
Tests for components/domains/logic/etc. Some guides on tests include:
- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/api.html)
- [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/index.html#basic-usage)
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/tutorial-react.html)
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/WritingTests.html)
- [Redux Saga](http://yelouafi.github.io/redux-saga/docs/advanced/Testing.html)

#### `*.stories.jsx`
Defines a story to display in React Storybook. Typically this file is in a component. (ex. `index.stories.jsx`) [This guide](https://gejstorybook.io/docs/react-storybook/basics/writing-stories) provides information on how to write stories.

#### `__snapshots__`
Generated files/directories when using Jest's [snapshot feature](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/tutorial-react.html#snapshot-testing). These files should be left to Jest and not touched manually.

## Tasks
Tasks can be executed in the following manner:
```
npm run [command]  # npm
yarn run [command] # Yarn
```
Examples:
```
npm run build:dev
yarn run lint
```

### `server:hot`
Start a local development server in port 3000 by default. To use another port have the environment variable `PORT` set to a number or modify `hot-server.js`. This task is also available as an alias to `server`. The following is provided in the development server:
- [Hot reloading](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html) (including [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader))
- [Redux DevTools Extension](http://zalmoxisus.github.io/redux-devtools-extension/) (if unavailable [Logger for Redux](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger) is used)

### `server:story`
Start a local server for React Storybook on port 9001. For more information visit the [documentation for React Storybook](https://getstorybook.io/docs).

### `build:dev`
Build application and include assets into a packaged build in the `dist/` directory. This build is not minifed and includes source maps. Ideal for development.

### `build:prod`
Build application and include assets into a packaged build in the `dist/` directory. This build is minified (with dead code elimination) and does not include source maps. Ideal for production. This task is also available as an alias to `start`. (`npm start`, `yarn start`)

### `build:docs`
Build detailed code documentation in the `docs/api/` directory.

### `build:story`
Generate a static build of React Storybook in the `story/` disrectory.

### `test`
Run tests once using Jest. For more information visit the [documentation for Jest](facebook.github.io/jest/docs/configuration.html).

### `test:watch`
Run tests once and rerun on changes using Jest.

### `lint`
Verify that code is valid using ESLint. For customzation modify `.eslintrc`.

### `lint:fix`
Like `lint` task, but automatically fixes certain linting violations.

### `coverage`
Like `test` task, but also collects code coverage, which becomes available in the `coverage/` directory.

### `coverage:watch`
Run converage once and rerun on changes using Jest.
